# Predicting Cancer Malignancy with Logistic Regression

We are provided a data set which includes 10 features, one of which is malignancy, 
called Class. The purpose of this exploration is to identify how we can use the 9 other features to predict cancer malignancy. We will also perform some exploratory analysis on the data set.
This study was conducted to learn if a new method called fine needle aspiration 
(which draws only a small tissue sample) could be effective in determining tumor status and prognosis. We take advantage of this study to explore the power of logistic regression.
The features include:

- Class - 0 if malignant, 1 if benign 
- Adhesion - marginal adhesion 
- BNuclei - bare nuclei
- Chromat - bland chromatin
- Epithel - epithelial cell size
- Mitoses - mitoses
- NNucleo - normal nucleoli
- ClThick - clump thickness
- UShape - cell shape uniformity
- UCSize - cell size uniformity

The code is availble in the repository. The study is [available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oXu2a3yc7_jFXt1akA0JX8jsJf3mZlmV/view?usp=sharing)
